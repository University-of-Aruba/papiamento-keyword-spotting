## üß≠ Overview
This repository accompanies the bachelor thesis by Joel Rajnherc entitled _"Speech-to-text model for keyword spotting applications in the Papiamento language within a healthcare environment"_. The goal of the thesis was to explore a [keyword spotting model](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/labs/shared/kws_feature_eng/kws_feature_eng.html) for the Papiamento language, which is spoken in Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura√ßao. An aspirational and sustainble goal is the creation of end-to-end AI voice interfaces in Papiamentu or Papiamento that can be embedded in various applications, including accessibility and healthcare.

The repository provides an implementation in PyTorch through a runnable notebook and linkage with the remote dataset. This is a classification task, trained on a dataset of almost 280 participants, containing a total of 16766 spectrogram arrays, each one second long, with six different keywords in Papiamento. Additionally, it includes an unknown class for samples that do not contain any of the keywords.

Our first PyTorch attempt with the dataset achieved a **97.14%** test-set accuracy using a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> **Think you can beat that?** We warmly invite fellow students and researchers to take on the challenge: improve the model, experiment with new techniques, and push the boundaries of keyword spotting in Papiamento. If you manage to set a new state-of-the-art, submit a pull request and claim your spot in the leaderboard (see further below)!

> [!NOTE]
> The dataset is also separately available on Zenodo at the following address: [Zenodo Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/1234567).

<br>

## ‚ö° Quick start
Simply <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/University-of-Aruba/papiamento-keyword-spotting/blob/main/notebook/papiamento-keyword-spotting.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a> that provides a free-tier compute environment.

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup locally in four steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/University-of-Aruba/papiamento-keyword-spotting.git
   cd papiamento-keyword-spotting
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment using the command line interface:
   <details>
   <summary>click to see instructions for Bash or Powershell...</summary>
   
   for `python`:
    
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   
   or `python3`:
   
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```
   
   , then activate it on Linux/macOS with
   
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   or on Windows (PowerShell) with
   
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
   
   . In case of access issues in PowerShell, run
   
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
   ```
    
   then retry activating the environment.
   </details>

3. Install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start Jupyter:

   from the command line 
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   which opens a browser at the address of your local Jupyter server. From there, open the file under `notebook/papiamento-keyword-spotting.ipynb`. Alternatively, you can open this file from your preferred code editor with Jupyter support (e.g., VS Code).
