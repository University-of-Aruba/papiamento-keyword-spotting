# Python Jupyter Notebook Project for Thesis

This repository accompanies the thesis and provides code, experiments, and documentation. It uses a virtual environment (venv) for dependency management.

## Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment

   for `python`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   or `python3`:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```
   , then activate it with
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start Jupyter:

   using 
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or from within your preferred code editor with Jupyter support (e.g., VS Code).

## Project Structure
- Notebooks and scripts for experiments
- requirements.txt for dependencies
- .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files

## Usage
- All code and results are provided for reproducibility.
- See individual notebooks for details.
